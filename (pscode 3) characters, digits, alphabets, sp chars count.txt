3. Count and output the NUMBER of an entered character in a string. 
Also output separate counts for alphabets(cap % small together), 
digits and other characters in same entered string.

DECLARE Str1 : STRING
DECLARE ThisChar, Char1 : CHARACTER
DECLARE Count ,CharCount, AlphaCount, DigitCount, SpCount : INTEGER

Str1 <-- “”
ThisChar <-- ‘’
Char1 <-- ‘’
CharCount <-- 0
AlphaCount <-- 0
DigitCount <-- 0
SpCount <-- 0

INPUT("Enter String to be processed : ", Str1)
INPUT("Enter character to be searched: ", Char1)

For Count = 1 To LENGTH(Str1)
            CharCount = CharCount + 1
            Char1 = Mid(Str1, Count, 1)
            Char1 = UCase(Char1)
            If Char1 >= "A" And Char1 <= "Z" Then
                AlphaCount = AlphaCount + 1
            ElseIf Char1 >= "0" And Char1 <= "9" Then
                DigitCount = DigitCount + 1
            Else : SpCount = SpCount + 1
            End If
        Next

OUTPUT("Number of characters: ", CharCount)
OUTPUT("Number of Alphabet: ", AlphaCount)
OUTPUT("Number of Digit: ", DigitCount)
OUTPUT("Number of Other characters: ", SpCount)
